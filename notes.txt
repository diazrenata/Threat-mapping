fix r2 order
apportion r2 among states, car, x
compare logloss to random - %of states

small alpha == small autocorrelation

map to make:
mean of b * 

map geo_effect

residuals: log(p_calc) 

plot residuals; if there is a spatial patt`ern in non-geo residuals there is un handled spatial autocorrelation

non spatial residuals stFALSE“error” plot and look for spatial pattern; if there’s a state pattern —> need states

non spatial residuals stTRUE “error” plot if there’s a pattern need CAR

try some with only endemics
