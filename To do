# To-do's
* add 2000 census data
* compile citations for all threat layers
* compare different mines/coal mines layers
* units of SHAPE_AREA?
* look at what "islands" really are re: CAR
* tidy up X key / analysis planning documents
* anything that is divided by  SHAPE_AREA:
 * convert to miles
 * divide by square miles instead
 * currently I think this is road density, rail density. pipelines, mines as well?
